= genesis-pong

[%hardbreaks%]
Old and unfinished Pong clone for the Sega Genesis, written in Motorola 68k assembly. Contains all the weird micro-optimizations and workarounds for assembler bugs I could fit into something this small.
I don't see myself ever finishing this, but I guess it could be a half-decent learning resource for someone.

== Building
* Place `asw` and `p2bin` from http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/[The Macroassembler AS] somewhere in your `PATH`
* Place `romfix` from Sik's https://github.com/sikthehedgehog/mdtools[mdtools] somewhere in your `PATH`
* Run `make all` and pray it works
